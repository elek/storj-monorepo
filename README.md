# Picobuf

Picobuf is a minimal replacement for [google.golang.org/protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go) with focusing on small binary size. This also means that it does not support all the features that the official version does.

If you do not have a binary size problem then you probably should prefer the official library.
